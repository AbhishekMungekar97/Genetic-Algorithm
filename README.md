## Genetic Algorithm (For Optimal Node Placement)
### - In this post i will be exploring a simplistic problem of Optimal Node placement, which is often the scenario in IoT networks. To optimize the placement of the sensors, we will use a genetic algorithm which will produce a sample population intially followed by optimizing their postions using the cross-over and mutation functions over several generations to come up with the best fit.
### - As a comparative measure, I will be utilizing the K-means clustering approach to see how well does the Genetic algorithm perform.
### - The performance will be evaluated on the basis of several silhouette scores to see how well does the Genetic Algorithm cover the given targets
### - Note : When it comes to optimal node placement, there is always a cost associated with the type of sensor used, and the radius that the sensor (node) covers. As the radius of coverage increases the cost associated with it also increases. Therefore, optimizing sensor placement has become a crucial task in recent times.
